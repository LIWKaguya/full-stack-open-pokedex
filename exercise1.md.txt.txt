Solution for exercise 11.1:
*For example if I choose Python as the main language, the pyLint can come in handy with linting, the PyUnit/UnitTesting for the test and you can as well use Buildbot for 
integration test. Lastly Bitbake/Buildout for building tool, however, python doesn't need build tool unless there are involves with extensions that need to be compiled and 
deployed can be use Github Actions.
*Beside Jenkins and Github Actions, there are many more as good as the two mentioned before such as: Teamcity, Travis, GoCD, GitLab, CircleCI ( which get a lot of advertise 
recently ) and Codeship. Take CircleCI for example, it supports currently now only in GitHub and what makes it special it that their services are offered by Containers. Thus,
CircleCI also support Docker which is an open source containerization platform and allows developers to package applications into containers.
*For environment like this, the best way is using cloud-based environment because there are only 6 people involve in the project and using Jenkins would take a lot of times
to configurate and it won't be as efficient using the GitHub actions which have all the tools available for basic needs. Moreover, using Jenkins meaning that you have to bill
monthly for their service which is not worth it for a small team project.
